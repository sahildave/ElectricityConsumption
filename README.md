<i><b>Project Title:</b></i> An interactive  JAVA tool to calculate energy  consumption of a building 

<i><b>Time period:</b></i> July 2010  to March 2011

<i><b>Mentor:</b></i>  Dr. Jyotirmay Mathur, Associate Prof, MNIT  Jaipur


This user-friendly  tool, made in JAV A, helps in analyzing the seasonal demand  of electricity in a 
building. The  user can select the type of device, number  of devices  and the average  daily usage  to  get 
the total energy  usage for a year. The  result contains a horizontal  stacked ba r graph  which  depicts the 
energy usage  of every  type of device  with the variation  of seasons.

This tool can be used to get an idea of the total energy  consumption of  a building  which can help the 
occupant to decide the type of power  source they want to opt i.e. Grid,  Standalone  etc. This utility can 
be  uploaded  on a website or used directly for a basic knowledge  about the buildingâ€™s energy  usage.
